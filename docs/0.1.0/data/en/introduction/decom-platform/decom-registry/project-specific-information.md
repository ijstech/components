# Project Specific Information

* **Funding Status**: DECOM Dapps and DECOM Docs can qualify for grant funding and the funding status will be _**Not Qualified**_  (New projects that do not meet the minimum staking level),  _**Under Consideration**_ (New projects that have been curated), or _**Granted**_  (Projects that have been granted by SC Foundation)
* **Project Bucket**: Each project that is set up to use Secure Compute (ie DECOM Doc or DECOM Dapp) will have 6 associated buckets that will be associated with the project.

| Bucket           | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Stake    | Serves as a project bond as authentic owner - Can be loss if validation failed / identified as abuse |

| Platform Bucket  | Funds used to pay DECOM Nodes for hosting services                                                   |

### Multi-chain

DECOM registries will be deployed to multiple blockchains to allow DApps projects to be registered based on the blockchain they are running on. For DApps that are multi-chain themselves, projects will be required to select the ‘primary’ chain which will serve as the single registration point.

Secure Compute will run an ‘Indexed’ version of the various registries to enable convenient lookup of information.
