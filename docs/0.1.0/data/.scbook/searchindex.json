[{"title":"Introduction","file":"README.md","slug":"README","text":"The Web3 landscape today is one of ‘User Beware’. Web3 users continue to lose funds by connecting their wallets to fake phishing sites, following instructions from compromised project documents or interacting with fake social media accounts.\nWeb3 users are asked to ‘be careful’ but in most cases, there is little that such users can do. DApps are rarely audited, there is no way to verify that the published source code is actually the same as the code being served from centralized web hosting providers and users also often find out ‘afterwards’ that the document they were following or social media account they were interacting with was compromised or fake.\nThe promises of web3 mass adoption are at risk as the only way to currently avoid the dangers is to avoid participation completely. This is a concern and industry leaders are recognizing that there needs to be a greater emphasis on fulfilling the principles of ‘decentralization’ not in a piecemeal manner but across the full technology stack.\nIt is from this background that Secure Compute emerges. Secure Compute is the first Zero Trust DApp stack protocol that enables DApps, Documents and project social media accounts and domains to be self-verifiable by web3 users. DApps, Documents and projects built and registered through Secure Compute’s DECOM platform provides transparency, tamper-resistance, phishing prevention and more in a decentralized platform.\nPowered by an ecosystem utility token and guided by a mission to make Web3 a safer environment for all, Secure Compute aims to be the new way of building Web3 DApps and Docs.&#x20;\n"},{"title":"Why Secure Compute?","file":"introduction/why-secure-compute/README.md","slug":"introduction/why-secure-compute/README","text":""},{"title":"The Web3 Potential","file":"introduction/why-secure-compute/the-web3-potential.md","slug":"introduction/why-secure-compute/the-web3-potential","text":"Web3 is a term that is commonly agreed to encompass the next evolution of the internet incorporating concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics.

Web3 users are currently faced with a ‘User Beware’ situation and risk losing the funds in their wallet every time they connect their wallets and transact with a current-generation DApp. There are numerous stories of users finding their wallets emptied due to what they thought was a legitimate site and transaction or signature.\nFake sites, fake social media channels and fake project documentation are other areas of risk for web3 users as it is very difficult to determine if a site is authentic or not or whether the site content was compromised.\nIn order for the optimistic web3 projections to come true, projects need to truly live up to the DOVE principles (Decentralization, Ownership, Verifiability, Execution) because the security problems being faced are due to the neglect of these principles.\nCurrent ‘so-called’ web3 DApps have the following architecture:\nAs one can see, most current Web3 DApps simply bolt on a wallet and some integration with blockchain smart contracts, but they still leverage the same centralized web 2.0 infrastructure for everything else, thereby creating the problem. Notably, there is no transparency on how the DApp is hosted, no transparency on what code is being served and no transparency on how the migration process for the DApp was handled. In other words, users need to blindly trust the centralized entities that still play a large role in current web3 DApps.\nTo fully live up to the web3 vision, there is a need for a Zero Trust approach that leverages the DOVE principles and enables the public to ‘validate’ DApps, Documents and social media accounts without the need to ‘Trust’ any centralized authority.\nIn an ideal web3 world, users should be able to self-verify and access the following:\n"},{"title":"A True Web3 Development Tool","file":"introduction/why-secure-compute/a-true-web3-development-tool.md","slug":"introduction/why-secure-compute/a-true-web3-development-tool","text":"Current blockchain projects have a difficult time living up to the full DOVE principles due to a lack of true Web3 DApp development infrastructure. Increasingly there are web3 infrastructure projects emerging that offer decentralized and transparent approaches for accessing blockchains, however, that is typically as far as they go.\nThe DApp Front End and middleware are typically still built using traditional web 2.0 approaches, namely leveraging web 2.0 frameworks like REACT, VUE.JS etc and the resulting DApp is also often hosted on centralized hosting solutions that provide little transparency to end users.\nAnother problem that plagues the DApp development environment is the clinging to the Web2.0 development approach of ‘anything goes’. Existing frameworks like REACT, VUE.JS etc., promote its ability to allow developers to build as they wish using nested libraries of code that lead to unlimited flexibility but come at a cost of being almost impossible to ‘audit’ and ‘endless’ hacking risks from the libraries of unreviewed and unaudited code.\nUnless there is a change in this approach, security risks and adoption risks of web3 will put the anticipated USD 81.5B industry at risk.\n"},{"title":"The Secure Compute Platform","file":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/README.md","slug":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/README","text":""},{"title":"Overview of Secure Compute","file":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/README.md","slug":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/README","text":"Secure Compute is the world’s first Zero Trust DApp Stack and the first to enable Web3 DApps that truly live up to the Web 3 DOVE principles (Decentralization, Ownership, Verifiability, Execution).\nWith Secure Compute, projects are able to tamper-proof their project information, DApps and project documentation and enable web3 users the ability to self-validate the authenticity of DApps, Documents and social media accounts.\n"},{"title":"Benefits for Adopting Secure Compute","file":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/benefits-for-adopting-secure-compute.md","slug":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/benefits-for-adopting-secure-compute","text":"Secure Compute is a protocol that is designed to enable blockchain projects to offer more secure, transparent and verifiable solutions to their community while themselves benefiting from:\n"},{"title":"Core Components","file":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/core-components.md","slug":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/core-components","text":"Secure Compute is a platform that consists of several components.\n"},{"title":"Ecosystem Members","file":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/ecosystem-members.md","slug":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/overview-of-secure-compute/ecosystem-members","text":"Secure Compute is a community-driven ecosystem, called the ‘VALIGLATORS’ that are incentivized through a $DECOM utility token and common guiding objective of bringing greater decentralization, transparency, accountability and security to the web3 ecosystem through the following roles:\n"},{"title":"DECOM Registry","file":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/decom-registry.md","slug":"introduction/the-secure-compute-platform/decom-registry","text":"The DECOM Registry is a smart contract and IPFS based record of project information, DECOM-Dapp configuration, Domain configuration and Secure-Compute based accounts/wallets.
