# Introduction

The Web3 landscape today is one of ‘User Beware’. Web3 users continue to lose funds by connecting their wallets to fake phishing sites, following instructions from compromised project documents or interacting with fake social media accounts.

Web3 users are asked to ‘be careful’ but in most cases, there is little that such users can do. DApps are rarely audited, there is no way to verify that the published source code is actually the same as the code being served from centralized web hosting providers and users also often find out ‘afterwards’ that the document they were following or social media account they were interacting with was compromised or fake.

The promises of web3 mass adoption are at risk as the only way to currently avoid the dangers is to avoid participation completely. This is a concern and industry leaders are recognizing that there needs to be a greater emphasis on fulfilling the principles of ‘decentralization’ not in a piecemeal manner but across the full technology stack.

It is from this background that Secure Compute emerges. Secure Compute is the first Zero Trust DApp stack protocol that enables DApps, Documents and project social media accounts and domains to be self-verifiable by web3 users. DApps, Documents and projects built and registered through Secure Compute’s DECOM platform provides transparency, tamper-resistance, phishing prevention and more in a decentralized platform.

Powered by an ecosystem utility token and guided by a mission to make Web3 a safer environment for all, Secure Compute aims to be the new way of building Web3 DApps and Docs.&#x20;
